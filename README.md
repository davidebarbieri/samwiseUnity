# Unity Integration for Samwise Dialogue System

This is the README for the Unity Integration plugin for the Samwise Dialogue System.
**Samwise™** is a game development tool for writing interactive dialogues. 

**Samwise™** consists of three components:
1. A scripting language for writing interactive dialogues;
2. A runtime library for parsing such files and supporting the execution of dialogues in a videogame;
3. A Visual Studio Code extension (this extension) that assists the developer in the task of writing dialogues and testing them quickly.

You can find the first two components in the official [repository](https://github.com/davidebarbieri/samwise)
and you can download the vscode extension from the extensions marketplace for free.

This is the Unity package that can be used to integrate Samwise files into your game development pipeline.

Please consider to support my work on [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/davidebarbieri)!

## Features

This plugin currently includes only the basic functions necessary for:

- Automatically parsing .sam files located in the subdirectories of Assets
- Tracking dialogues
- Displaying dialogue references from the Inspector
- Identifying the external code parser (if present)
- Checking statistics

I expect to expand (or change) the features as the tool is used by users.
